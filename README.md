# LogoMaker

# <h3>Description<h3>

I built this application to create a Node.js command line application that takes in user input to generate a log and save it as a  SVF file. 
The application allows users to generate a simple logo without having to pay a graphic designer. 
I have learned object oriented and modular programming while building this application.

- The application features SVG generation, allowing users to create custom logos with different shapes, colors, and text.
- Users can select from various shapes such as circles, triangles, and squares, and add text with specified content, color, and positioning within the SVG image.
- Customization options include choosing the color of shapes and text to match branding or design preferences.
- The generated SVG images have fixed dimensions of 300x200 pixels by default, ensuring consistency in size for the logos.
- Error handling mechanisms are implemented to manage invalid input, such as selecting an unsupported shape.
- The application code is organized into separate modules for better maintainability and readability, with distinct files for shape definitions, SVG generation, and main application logic.
- Unit tests are included to verify the correctness of key functionalities such as shape rendering and SVG generation.
- Users interact with the application through a command-line interface, providing a straightforward way to input parameters and generate SVG logos.
- The application is designed for cross-platform compatibility, allowing users to create logos on different operating systems.
